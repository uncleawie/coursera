## UncleAwie's Coursera Coursework 

Feel free to look around but I am not sure this is off sufficient interest or quality to warrant anyone else's attention. 
This repository relates to work from the Coursera Courses

### Some notes so far 
I first modified this file directly with the github gui. Then I did a
```
git clone https://github.com/uncleawie/coursera
```

This was first `git commit`ed to my local repository and then committed back to github using push 
```
git commit -m 'Trying to push this back to github
```
and then
```
git push README.md 
```

Then I discovered I had the syntax for code blocks wrong int he markdown.  So I corrected this using the [Markdown Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

### Viewing Markup in Terminal
